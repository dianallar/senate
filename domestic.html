                    <h3>“Empowered women empower nations.”</h3>

                    <p>For decades, women have fought for the right to control our own bodies, but today, those freedoms are under siege. As a mother, a survivor, and someone who has had an abortion before, I know firsthand how deeply personal these decisions are. No politician should ever dictate what Pacifican women do with their bodies.</p>

                    <h3>As your Senator, I will:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Codify Roe v. Wade's protections</b> into the constitution, guaranteeing abortion access nationwide.</li>
                    <li><b>Eliminate taxes</b> on menstrual products, contraception, and prenatal care, because basic healthcare and the means to make your own decisions are not luxuries, or, at the very least, they should not be, in the greatest nation on the face of the planet.</li>
                    <li><b>Expand the Violence Against Women Act</b> to include LGBTQ+ survivors and fund rape crisis centers in every state.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This fight does not stop at a woman's right to choose and make her own medical decisions. <i>It's also about justice:</i></p>

                    <p><b>Pay equity.</b> Women still earn 82 cents for every dollar men make—and it's worse for Black, Latina, and Native women. We'll enforce equal pay laws and fine corporations that discriminate.</p>

                    <p><b>Parental support.</b> Universal childcare. Paid family leave. Protections for pregnant workers. No one should have to choose between their job and their family.</p>

                    <p><b>Bodily sovereignty.</b> Ban forced sterilizations of disabled and incarcerated women. End the tampon tax. Prosecute domestic abusers to the fullest extent of the law—no exceptions.</p>

                    <p>Republicans want to drag us back to the 1950s. <b>We won't let them.</b> Together, we'll build a future where every woman, cis or trans, has the freedom to thrive.</p></p>

                    <h3>“Education is the passport to the future.”</h3>
                    <p>Every child in America deserves access to a world-class public education - regardless of their zip code, family income, or background. As a former school counselor and the mother of a public school student, I've seen firsthand how our current system fails too many children. We must invest in our schools, respect our teachers, and prepare students for the future. As Lieutenant Governor of Olympia, I introduced and passed the PUTA Act, which substantially increased the minimum wage for teachers. I'd like to implement a similar policy on the national stage.</p>

                    <h3>As your Senator, I will:</h3>

                    <ul>
                    <li><b>End the teacher shortage crisis</b> with a 15% federal wage subsidy and student loan forgiveness for educators</li>
                    <li><b>Fix our broken school funding model</b> by replacing property taxes with federal needs-based funding</li>
                    <li><b>Guarantee mental health support</b> with at least two counselors per school and universal mental health support cost coverage</li>
                    <li><b>Make college and trade school debt-free</b> through federal subsidies and income-contingent repayment plans</li>
                    <li><b>Modernize our curriculum</b> with comprehensive sex education, civics education, renewed geography and geopolitical courses, vocational training, and climate literacy</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Key Priorities:</h3>

                    <p><b>Early Childhood:</b> Universal pre-K for all 3- and 4-year-olds, with living wages for childcare workers</p>

                    <p><b>K-12 Reform:</b> Smaller class sizes (25:1 max ratio), updated facilities, and free school meals</p>

                    <p><b>Higher Education:</b> Tuition-free community college and expanded Pell Grants</p>

                    <p><b>Vocational Training:</b> Federal partnerships with unions to create apprenticeship pipelines</p>

                    <p>For too long, we've underfunded our schools while overtesting our children. My administration will <i>actually</i> invest in the next generation - because education isn't an expense, it's the foundation of our democracy and our economy.</p>

                    <h3>“Dignity in work, pride in progress.”</h3>
                    <p>The American labor movement built the middle class - but for decades, corporate interests and Republican politicians have waged war on workers' rights. As the author of the <b>Collective Bargaining Rights Amendment</b>, I'm fighting to enshrine union rights in our Constitution because no worker should have to beg for fair pay and safe conditions.</p>
                    <h3>My Constitutional Amendment Will:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Permanently guarantee</b> the right to unionize and collectively bargain</li>
                    <li><b>Ban "right-to-work" laws</b> that weaken unions</li>
                    <li><b>Protect striking workers</b> from retaliation</li>
                    <li><b>Establish sectoral bargaining</b> so unions can negotiate industry-wide standards</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As President, I signed into law the Right to Disconnect Act, which ensures that workers can disengage from work communications during non-work hours without fear of repercussions. I also signed into law the Employment Mobility and Competition Act, which banned non-compete agreements and non-disclosure agreements focused on assault, and the Industry Finance and Insurance Act, which revitalized domestic investment in manufacturing and provided a support boost for United States Exporters, protecting jobs and strengthening our economy.</p>

                    <h3>As a Senator, these will be my priorities in regards to Labor and the Workforce:</h3>

                    <p><b>Modern Worker Protections:</b>
                    <br>32-hour workweek • Paid family leave • Mandatory breaks • Predictable scheduling</p>

                    <p><b>Rebuild Union Power:</b>
                    <br>Card check recognition • First contract arbitration • Ban permanent replacements</p>

                    <p><b>Living Wages:</b>
                    <br>$25 federal minimum wage for teachers • Equal pay certification • Tip credit elimination</p>

                    <p>From the picket lines to the factory floors, American workers deserve dignity. My platform will <i>finally</i> give American labor the protections it deserves - because when our economy is strong, America is strong.</p>

                    <p>America is a nation of immigrants - but our broken system traps millions in uncertainty while failing to secure our borders. My plan combines compassion with common sense: expanding legal pathways while cracking down on smuggling cartels and employers who exploit undocumented workers. Pacifica is a very diverse state, rich in culture spanning hundreds of years, several communities, nations, and populations. As your Senator, I will work to ensure that all who wish to come to America (hopefully Pacifica!) and call this place their home can do so freely, for everyone should be allowed to partake in the project that is the greatest nation in the world. I plan to prioritize several policies that will make immigration a more humane process, including:</p>

                    <h3>Pathway to Citizenship:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Immediate status</b> for Dreamers, farmworkers, and essential workers</li>
                    <li><b>8-year citizenship path</b> for undocumented immigrants with clean records</li>
                    <li><b>Vocational fast-track</b>: Earn citizenship through skilled work in high-need areas</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Border Security & Reform:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Triple asylum officers</b> to clear backlog while maintaining due process</li>
                    <li><b>Smart surveillance</b> with drones and sensors instead of wasteful walls</li>
                    <li><b>Anti-cartel task force</b> with DEA and international partners</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Worker Protections:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Ban ICE workplace raids</b> that punish workers instead of exploitative employers</li>
                    <li><b>Expand H-2B visas</b> with union wage requirements</li>
                    <li><b>Whistleblower visas</b> for workers who report labor violations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We'll replace chaos with order - welcoming those who follow the rules while holding accountable those who break them. Our plan strengthens America's workforce while finally fixing this unsustainable system.</p>

                    <h3>“There is no Planet B.”</h3>
                    <p>Climate change isn't a distant threat - it's burning through our neighborhoods and flooding our streets today. My plan meets this crisis with the urgency it demands while creating millions of union jobs in clean energy. We'll lead the world in innovation without leaving workers behind. Throughout my careeer, I have supported every bill introduced by my colleagues Ducky Anka and Threes Twos to mitigate our negative environmental impact and move the United States towards a greener future that ensures the long-term stability and longevity of our planet and our environment. As your Senator, I will take several more crucial steps past those perpetuated by Senator Anka and Former President Twos to ensure that we continue the American vision of giving more back to the world than we take and fulfilling the promise of a new tomorrow for <i>all.</i> Here are some of those steps that I plan to take:</p>

                    <h3>Climate Action Now:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>100% clean electricity by 2035</b> through renewable investments and grid modernization</li>
                    <li><b>Civilian Climate Corps</b> employing 1.5 million Americans to restore ecosystems</li>
                    <li><b>Carbon tariff</b> on polluting imports to protect U.S. industry</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Environmental Justice:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Replace every lead pipe</b> in America within 5 years</li>
                    <li><b>Ban new fossil fuel projects</b> near communities of color</li>
                    <li><b>Superfund cleanup acceleration</b> with polluter pay requirements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Green Industrial Revolution:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Union-made</b> requirement for all federal clean energy projects</li>
                    <li><b>American Battery Initiative</b> to dominate EV supply chains</li>
                    <li><b>Farmers Conservation Corps</b> paying landowners for carbon sequestration</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This is about creating good-paying jobs and protecting our planet while saving our communities. We'll beat the climate crisis and build the most competitive economy in the world.</p>

                    <p>America's infrastructure is crumbling while other nations speed ahead. My plan will create millions of union jobs rebuilding our country with smart investments in sustainable transit, resilient systems, and connected communities. In recent years, since 2019 more specifically, the United States has made numerous advancements in infrastructure, much to the benefit of our communities, but there is always room for improvement. Creating connectivity is a hefty project. I was proud to cosponsor Ducky Anka's Transportation Equity and Tolling Reform Act (TETRA) in the Senate, which made it illegal to use highway tolls for anything other than infrastructure improvement, maintenance, and repair. As your Senator, I implement several initiatives to continue to increase our national infrastructure standard, including:</p>

                    <h3>Modernizing America's Backbone:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>National high-speed regional connector rail network</b> connecting all major metros by 2040, in consultation with President Fields</li>
                    <li><b>Complete Streets Initiative</b> redesigning 100,000 miles of roads for bikes, buses and pedestrians</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Community-Centered Projects:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Neighborhood Infrastructure Grants</b> letting communities prioritize local needs</li>
                    <li><b>Universal Broadband</b> through municipal fiber and 5G cooperatives</li>
                    <li><b>Clean Water for All</b> replacing every lead service line in America</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Workforce & Innovation:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Project Labor Agreements</b> required for all federal infrastructure projects</li>
                    <li><b>Infrastructure Academy</b> training workers for green construction jobs</li>
                    <li><b>ARPA-Infrastructure</b> funding next-gen materials and smart city tech</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In the Senate, I will work to reimagine how America moves, starting with fixing potholes. From rural broadband to bullet trains, we'll build infrastructure worthy of our people and our future.</p>

I have long advocated for a fairer justice system that achieves its ultimate purpose: Enforcing the law in a reasonable, fair, and just manner.

                    <li><b>Community Safety Grants</b> to fund mental health responders instead of armed officers for crisis calls</li>
                    <li><b>Increasing the minimum police training period</b> to ensure that our officers are properly trained and capable of carrying out their jobs</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Prison & Sentencing Reform:</h3>

                    <h3>“Home is where opportunity begins.”</h3>
                    <p>Safe, stable housing is the foundation of strong communities - yet, skyrocketing rents and corporate landlords have pushed millions to the brink. My plan guarantees housing as a human right through bold federal action. Throughout my career, I have consistently stood beside plans to bolster our national infrastructure, and that includes housing. As your Senator, here are some things I will strive for to end the housing crisis and lower housing costs for everyone:</p>

                    <h3>Immediate Relief:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>National rent stabilization</b> capping annual increases at 3% or inflation (whichever is lower)</li>
                    <li><b>Emergency tenant protections</b> banning no-cause evictions and unfair fees</li>
                    <li><b>Direct rental assistance</b> for households spending over 30% of income on housing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Build Generational Wealth:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>First-generation homebuyer grants</b> covering 20% down payments</li>
                    <li><b>Community land trusts</b> preserving affordability in gentrifying neighborhoods</li>
                    <li><b>Triple funding</b> for Section 8 vouchers until waitlists are eliminated</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Crush Speculation:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>25% tax</b> on corporate home purchases</li>
                    <li><b>Vacancy penalties</b> for landlords hoarding empty units</li>
                    <li><b>Public housing construction</b> adding 5 million units by 2035</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>End Homelessness:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Housing First</b> guaranteeing shelter with wraparound services</li>
                    <li><b>Repurpose vacant offices</b> as supportive housing</li>
                    <li><b>Mental health/addiction treatment</b> integrated into all shelters</li>

                    <p>Healthcare is a human right. As the primary sponsor of the <b>Fix the Public Option Act</b>, which established universal coverage, built 500+ public hospitals, and secured our medical supply chain, I’ve proven we can guarantee care for all while cutting costs. Furthermore, I authored and introduced the No Chemicals In American Cosmetics Act, which banned parabens in comestics and sunscreen, and the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, which sought to coordinate programs to eliminate the obesity epidemic. Now, we’ll finish the job.</p>

                    <li><b>✔️ Broke Big Pharma’s monopoly</b> with federal generic drug manufacturing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As your Senator, I will continue this streak by adhering to the following policies:</p>

                    <p><b>1. Pandemic-Proof America:</b>
                    <br>• Quadruple stockpiles of PPE, vaccines, and antivirals

                    <br>• Deploy mobile clinics to underserved areas within 72 hours of emergencies</p>

                    <p><b>2. End Healthcare Apartheid:</b>
                    <br>• Ban medical debt collections and erase existing debt
                    <br>• Triple funding for mobile clinics in rural/Black/Latino/Native communities
                    <br>• Jail CEOs of hospitals that violate patient privacy or deny emergency care</p>
